# INTRODUCTION

This "project" started by my curiosity about the covid-19 spread around the world. In my own country, and after everyone knows all health authorities' rules the virus is now attacking harder than never before. Why the virus continues to spread is one of my big questions. So I did this simulation-like project to study the influences of people behavior in the overall number of infected people. As an example, evaluating the influence of 10% of the people within an area do not wear a mask, or do not respect the social distance as we should.

# REQUIREMENTS

To run this project you should have `python>=3.8.3`, as it was developed using that version. 

# INSTALLATION

To install the necessary libraries run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` at the project root folder.

# CONFIGURATION

To configure the simulation you can use the `config.yaml` file at the root folder.
  

# How to Run

Run the command `python ./main.py -h` or `python ./main.py --help` to see how to run the simulation.
